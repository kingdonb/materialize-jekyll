The July Hephy Roadmap, or "Open Roadmap/Community Planning" meeting for July 2020 is on 7/9 (July 9) at 2PM Eastern Time.

Please join us!

---

Meeting time is regularly set for 2:00PM EST on the first Thursday of every month. In July 2020, instead we will meet on July 9 at 2:00PM EST.

Adding this meeting directly to your calendar will (hopefully) enable you to receive the most current information about when our meeting is planned. (Can someone test this and let me know or verify if it got the updated July 9 date this time? I think I updated it correctly, so the link should be stable each month and any reschedules are applied to your calendar automatically. I'm not sure... -Kingdon)

[Mark your calendars](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MTA5aG5qM2Zpa2NlcnZ2OXA4aHVvOTlxMzFfMjAxOTAyMDdUMTkwMDAwWiBrcXBkaDAzMzZsbmU5OTJsZDNnNjBuOTZ0Y0Bn&tmsrc=kqpdh0336lne992ld3g60n96tc%40group.calendar.google.com&scp=ALL)!

We are evaluating whether it would be helpful to engage more community members in the meetings, if we held the meeting at a different time of day or week! Please interested parties feel free to share your opinion on Slack, or send feedback privately to [team at teamhephy.com](mailto:team@teamhephy.com). We are not married to the 2:00PM Thursday format schedule for our meetings, and will consider your feedback.

Thanks!
