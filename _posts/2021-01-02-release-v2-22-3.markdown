Development on Team Hephy's "Hephy Workflow v2.22" continues! A new patch release, v2.22.3, has been made on January 2, which includes updated releases of Controller, Fluentd, NSQ, Slugbuilder, and [teamhephy/workflow][], the umbrella chart.

You can find [the changelogs](https://docs.teamhephy.com/changelogs/v2.22.3/) in the usual place, in [the docs][], right next to the [contributor guide][]... which is unfortunately a bit dated, (though still full of useful information for anyone seeking to volunteer or contribute with our team.)

The next Open Roadmap meeting will be Thursday Feb 4 at 2PM Eastern. (Apologies as well that in our docs, [the Roadmap][] itself has not been updated since 2017. Volunteer opportunities!)

As the Zoom meeting link is changing due to some news we discussed at [the January open roadmap][], please join us [on Slack][] before the meeting time to join, or please [join our Slack][] if you are new to the community.

All are welcome to attend. Meeting time is set as usual for 2:00PM EST on the first Thursday of every month.

Thanks!
