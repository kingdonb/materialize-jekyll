The Deis project is excited to announce [v1.6.0](https://github.com/deis/deis/releases/tag/v1.6.0)
with a technology preview of a Docker
[Swarm](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/customizing_deis/choosing-a-scheduler/#swarm-scheduler)-based
app scheduler and new `deis ps:restart` and `deis users:list` commands.

Deis is now supported by [Engine Yard](http://deis.io/deis-meet-engine-yard/)!

If you are coming from an earlier version of Deis, please read the ["Upgrading Deis"](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/upgrading-deis/) documentation for details.

## What is Deis?

Deis is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own
servers. Deis builds upon [Docker](http://docker.io/) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) to provide
a lightweight PaaS with a Heroku-inspired workflow.

## 1.6.0 Summary

### New Features

- Docker [Swarm](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/customizing_deis/choosing-a-scheduler/#swarm-scheduler)
  is available for preview as an alternative to
  [Fleet](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/customizing_deis/choosing-a-scheduler/#fleet-scheduler) for
  scheduling application units
- EC2 provisioning supports the
  [Proxy Protocol](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/enable-proxy-protocol.html),
  allowing WebSocket support for apps through an Elastic Load Balancer
- SSL certificates in SAN format are now supported
- `deis users:list` allows an admin to see all registered Deis users
- `deis ps:restart` stops and starts all containers, all those of a process type,
  or a single container
- `deis config:push` allows a `--path` argument to the `.env` file
- `deis logs` accepts `-n` to limit the number of lines displayed
- user registration can be `enabled`, `disabled`, or set to `adminOnly`
- logging level in router can be customized
- the number of worker processes in controller can be scaled

### Improvements

- `deis register` checks for a valid controller URL before continuing
- logger exposes its config as feature flags, and is more extensible
- Azure provisioning creates a load-balanced HTTPS endpoint
- EC2 provisioning shows a countdown timer and reports any CloudFormation errors
- `git push` errors are handled and reported more reliably
- `deis keys:add` uses SSH fingerprints to determine uniqueness
- registry determines S3 bucket name dynamically from `etcd`
- moved route53-wildcard.py script to contrib/ec2 to help with DNS setup
- `make -C controller/ postgres` creates a DB container for running unit tests

### Under the Hood

- bumped CoreOS to 633.1.0
- updated Ceph to "Hammer" release
- bumped `confd` to v0.9.0 in all components
- builder now uses the official `heroku/cedar:14` image
- router updated to nginx 1.9 for stream module TCP support
- added new C4 instance types to EC2 provisioning
- added sfo1 and ams2 data centers to DigitalOcean provisioning

For more details, please see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).


## What's Next

### New Container Schedulers

Application containers require a resource-aware scheduler to improve cluster efficiency at scale
and to alleviate issues with [cluster balancing after the loss of a node](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/2920).
In addition to the [Swarm](https://github.com/deis/deis/pull/3612) technology preview in this
release, prototyping is underway with [Kubernetes](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/2744)
and [Mesos](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/3538).

Deis will default to using [fleet](https://github.com/coreos/fleet) for both control plane and
data plane scheduling for the foreseeable future.

### Improved Test Infrastructure

We need to speed up test suites and increase test coverage to include operational aspects such as
upgrades and HA. Hard work behind the scenes and invaluable community support are steadily
improving the Deis test infrastructure.
